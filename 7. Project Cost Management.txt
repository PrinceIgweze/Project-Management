
PROJECT COST MANAGEMENT

- Human and physical resources 

PLANNING COST MANAGEMENT 

- Subsidiary plan of the project management plan

- Addresses three other cost management processes:
	- How cost are estimated
	- How the project budget is managed
	- How costs will be controlled 

CREATING COST ESTIMATES
- Predict based on current information

- Cost tradeoffs and risk considered
	- Cost versus buy
	- Cost versus lease
	- Sharing resources

- Level of accuracy
	- Rough order of magnitude
	- Budget estimate
	- Definitive estimate

- All categories of cost estimated 



TYPES OF ESTIMATES

- Rough Order of Magnitude Estimate
	A rough estimate made early in the project, often when little detailed information is available.

- Budget Estimate
	A more refined estimate that is developed after considering more detailed information, such as 
	project scope, schedule and resources

- Definitive Estimate
	The most accurate estimate, based on available information, including historical data, detailed 
	resource analysis, and expert judgement. Often used later in the planning phase

- Analogous Estimate (Top-Down Estimate)
	An estimate based on historical data from similar projects or activities. Quick an inexpensive

- Parametric Estimate
	Method used in estimating cost or durations based on specific parameters or variable. It uses
	mathematical models or statistical relationships to predict future outcomes based on 
	historical data and project parameters

= Three-Point Estimate
	An estimate technique that used different values to provide a more comprehensive estimate. The three 	values are: Optimistic (0), Pessimistic (P), Most Likely (M)
