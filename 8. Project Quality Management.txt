
PROJECT QUALITY MANAGEMENT


Terminologies:

Variable Sampling: Results rated on a continuous scale that measures the degree of conformity

Tolerances: Specified range of acceptable results

Control Limits: Identify the boundaries of common variation in a statistically stable process or process performance


PLANNING QUALITY MANAGEMENT

- Defined quality policy for the project
- Defined quality assurances requirements
- Defined how quality control activities will occur 

TYPES OF QUALITY COST

- Prevention: Quality assurance, delivering the exact project scope and the expected quality. Examples: training, safety measures, and right tools and equipment

- Appraisal: Quality control, cost of measuring, testing, auditing, and evaluating time for testing

- Failure: Internal failure: scrap and rework. External failure: Loss of sales, loss of customers, downtime, and damage to reputation 

QUALITY MANAGEMENT PLAN

- Control Quality:
	Results are monitored for quality standards
	Poor results need root cause analysis
	Quality control is inspection-driven

- Managing quality:
	Performance must meet quality standards
	QA maps to an organization's quality policy
	QA is typically a managerial process

- Quality improvement: 
	Corrective actions improve the project 
	Improvements depend on quality philosophy of the organization

CONTROLLING PROJET QUALITY 

- Monitor and measure project results
- Root-cause analysis follows the quality control
- Root-cause analysis enables determine the cause
- Apply corrective actions
- QC occurs throughout the life of a project

CONTROLLING QUALITY
- Controlling the quality of the product and the product
- Project management processes
- Measures performance, scheduling, and cost
- Management of the project should be of quality 

INSPECTING RESULTS
- Reviews
- Product reviews
- Audits
- Walkthroughs

Cause-and-effect charts
Fish bone or Ishikawa diagram - Helps facilitate the conversation on the root cause analysis 

Control chart - Shows how stable a repeatable process is 

Pareto diagram - Shows the categories of defects from largest to smallest
