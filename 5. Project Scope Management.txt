
PROJECT SCOPE MANAGEMENT 


The product scope and project scope go hand in hand 

Product scope: Features and functions
Project scope: Work to be completed

SCOPE AND PROJECT LIFE CYCLES

1. Predictive - Project scope defined at beginning
2. Adaptive - Project scope developed through iterations
3. Predictive - Change resistant
4. Adaptive - expects change

SCOPE AND PROJECT COMPLETION

- Project scope is measured against project plan
- Product scope is measured against project requirements
- Requirements are conditions or capabilities that must exist in a product, service, or result


PLANNING PROJECT SCOPE

Scope Management Plan

- This does not define the project scope
- It details how to create the project scope statement
- How the WBS will be created
- How the scope baseline will be approved and maintained 
- How formal acceptance of the deliverables happen

Requirement Management Plan

- How will the requirement activities happen, be planned, tracked and reported
- Define configuration management (this is about the features and functions of the product)


Agile Requirement Gathering

- User Stories - defines
	- Role - who benefits from the feature
	- Goal - what the stakeholders aim to accomplish
	- Motivation - benefit to the stakeholder

Difference between a project charter and project scope

A charter is all about authority, while the project scope is all about delivery



CREATING THE WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE(WBS)

- This is the decomposition of the project scope
- The smallest item in the WBS is called the work package

WBS DICTIONARY: A glossary of all of the work packages. It could include things like the duration, cost, risk to watch out for etc

PERFORMAING SCOPE VALIDATION
- Scope inspection: The customer inspects the deliverable and the focus is on acceptance
- Quality control: Keeping mistakes out of the customers hands

CONTROLLING PROJECT SCOPE

Questions to ask when controlling scope: 
- Are changes agreed upon ?
- Has the change already happened ?
- How to manage the existing change ?
- How to incorporate approved changes?
- What baselines are affected by the change ?

The types of baselines
- Scope baseline
- Schedule baseline
- Cost baseline
