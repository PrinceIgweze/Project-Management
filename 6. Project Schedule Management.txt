Agile Release Planning

- High-level summary timeline of the release schedule
- 3 to 6 months
- Product roadmap and product vision
- Determines the number of iterations or sprints
- How much need to be developed 
- How long it will take to have a releasable product


BURNDOWN CHART

- Shows a plot of work to be done vs iteration days


DECOMPOSE PROJECT ACTIVITIES

- Activity list and work packages
- Work package should be no greater than 80 hours and no less than 8 hours
- Requires 3 outputs
 	- Scope baseline
	- Enterprise environmental  factors
	- Organizational process assets

ROLLING WAVE PLANNING

ACTIVITY LIST

- A big list of all the project activities
- Activity identifier
- Scope of work description

EFFORT AND PROJECT ACTIVITIES

- Level of effort activities : these are support activities
	- Reporting
	- Budgeting

- Discrete effort activities: activities required to complete the project scope

- Apportioned effort: these a project management work
	- Quality assurance
	- Integrated change control 
 	- Communications

MILESTONE CHART

- Shows when milestone will be reached 
- Up triangle is planned
- Down triangle is actual 


DEVELOPING THE PROJECT SCHEDULE

Dependency Determination
- Mandatory dependencies - hard logic
- Discretionary dependencies - soft logic
- External dependencies - external constraint
- Internal dependencies - type of hard logic

LEAD AND LAG
- Lead is on the successor activity and it is negative time. It allows activities to overlap
- Lag is waiting time. lag moves activities further apart


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CREATING DURATION ESTIMATES

- Task are first identified
- Sequencing of the activities
- Recourses defined
- Durations are estimated
- Four activities are iterated


EXTIMATING DURATION CONSIDERATIONS

- Law of diminishing returns
	- Increase in resources will eventually yield diminishing returns

- Number of resources
	- Adding resources does not necessarily reduce duration
	- Risk
	- Knowledge transfer/Learning Curve

- Advance in technology
	- Faster equipment/Learning Curve

- Motivation of staff
	- Student syndrome/Parkinson's law (work expands to fill the allocated time)


THREE POINT ESTIMATE
- Find the average of 
	- Optimistic
	- Most Likely
	- Pessimistic
	- Also called triangular distribution

- (O + ML + P ) / 3 = Estimate

BOTTOM UP ESTIMATING

- Usually a term associated with cost estimates
- Can be used for resource estimating 
- Required a fully-decomposed WBS for each work package
- Estimate how many and what type of resources you'll need to create that work package
