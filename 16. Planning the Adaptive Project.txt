Agile Stakeholder Engagement 

- Agile project manager works with stakeholders
- Not command and control 
- Consider servant leadership
- Identify project stakeholders as early as possible
- People new to agile projects need come basic education
- Address concerns directly with project stakeholders
- Explain the approach that will be used


Managing stakeholder engagement 
- Short iterations keep stakeholders involved
- Review and demos show the results of the work 
- Agile placed value of he work that is done
- Agile is naturally visible for project stakeholders


Principles of stakeholder engagement
- Get the right stakeholders 
- Ensure a stakeholder participation
- Manage stakeholder interest
- Frequently discussed what done looks like 
- Show progress to project stakeholders
- Openly discuss project estimates and projections

Individuals and Interactions
- Respect for the worth of every person
- Truth in every communication
- Transparency of all data, actions, and decisions
- Trust that each person will support the team
- Commitment to the team and to the teams goals 




DETERMINING PRIORITIES

Considerations for requirements prioritization

- Value - business benefit
- Cost - expense versus ROI
- Risk - riskiest requirement first 


TESTING FOR VALUE

Gulf of evaluation
- The difference between what is said and what is understood
- Intangible projects often experience this gulf 
- What does DONE look like ?


Unit Testing
- Unit - smallest testable portion of application code
	- Entire module
	- Function
	- Procedure
	- Basically, code fragments 
- Automated process for testing
- Isolated testing for validity 


Acceptance testing
Test to determine acceptability of results:
- Specific requirement
- Specification
- Contract requirements 


Exploratory testing 
- The tester aims to discover issues and unexpected behaviour
- Tester explores the software
- This is in addition to scripted testing

Performing continuous integration in agile projects 
- Incorporate new and changed code into the code repository
- Small code commits
- Frequency integration
- Relies on automated tools to integrate code when new code is checked in
